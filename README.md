Pack your files, directories and content from other archives in one archive easily!

Using:
1. Enter full path to an archive in what you want to copy data (even if you don't have one) (for example c:/temp/archive.zip or archive.rar)
2. If you want to work with existing archive print 'false' or create new one with little bit similar name 'true'
3. After this you can choose one regime:
	- FILE (copying a file to main archive);
	- DIRECTORY (copying a directory and inner files/directories to main archive);
	- ARCHIVE (copying all the data from an archive to main archive).
4. Enter path to file/directory/archive.

*. Please, don't open the archive while program working. Firstly, you need to print EXIT.
*. Print EXIT whenever you want to stop program and save the changes you've already made.

Launching:
1. Clone the project
2. With cmd go to the project folder
3. Then go to the 'src' folder
4. Run command 'java program.Main'
